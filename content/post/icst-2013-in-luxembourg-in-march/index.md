Both as a publicity chair and as a proud member of the community, I''d
    like to remind everyone of the next instance of the International Conference
    on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST 2013) this coming
    March. ICST will be in Luxembourg, which is one of the world''s most developed
    countries and the world''s second highest GDP (all of which, I just learned
    on Wikipedia). It''s a great conference with cutting edge research and
    a friendly, welcoming, open atmosphere. Luxembourg is the "icing on the
    cake." I''m really looking forward to it, and hope that you''ll join us
    in March.
