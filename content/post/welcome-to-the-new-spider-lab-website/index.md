We''re excited to present our new research group website. There has
    been a lot of stuff happening here, and it''s about time that we had a
    good platform for sharing these exciting events. This version of the website
    is still in its infancy, so we''re sure to evolve it into better shape
    in the near future.

And, as we certainly know from our studies of software bugs, they''re
    always there... so if you find some problems or incompatibilities, please
    send them along, and we''ll snag them in our web them as soon as possible.

Feel free to poke around and explore. There is a lot of content here,
    with way more to come.
