Nicholas is a Ph.D. student studying software engineering in the Department of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine.  He currently holds a B.S. in Information and Computer Science from the same school.

Nicholas works with Professor James A Jones in the Spider lab.  James''
    research is focused on software testing, analysis and debugging.  The
    lab''s focus is varied, but speaking broadly is in software development
    along with the processes that go along with it mainly focusing on maintenance.

Nicholas'' personal interests are in understanding how to create better
    software through the automated elimination of bugs.  He is interested
    in how to locate bugs, and importantly how and what to provide developers
    to assist them in creating bug free software.  The development of tools
    and techniques that can assist in that process along with visualization
    concepts are also part of my studies.
