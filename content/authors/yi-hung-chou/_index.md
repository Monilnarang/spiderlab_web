Yi-Hung Chou is a first-year Ph.D. student at UC Irvine. He received B.Sc Computer Science with ELITE stream from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and he earned his Master of Science in Software Engineering at UC Irvine this summer. Throughout his academic journey, he has been fortunate to have the guidance and mentorship of exceptional professors, including Prof. David Redmiles, Prof. Rafael Prikladnicki, Prof. Tobias Schimmer, and Prof. Steven Dow. His mind is delightfully contaminated by Ti-Chung Cheng and Dr. Grace Yen, who lured Yi-Hung away from his lucrative and routine software engineer life into the wild, unpredictable world of academia.
