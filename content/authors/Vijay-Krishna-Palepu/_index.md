Vijay's research interests primarily revolve around software engineering
    and user interfaces. His research interests are in program visualization
    and code comprehension, which would be a natural extension to his work
    in his undergraduate final year project. Vijay's goal is to make the processes
    of reading-of-code and testing as easy as possible.
