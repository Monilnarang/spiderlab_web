abstract: Before a fault can be fixed, it first must be understood. However, understanding
  why a system fails is often a difficult and time consuming process. While current
  automated-debugging techniques provide assistance in knowing where a fault is, developers
  are left unaided in understanding what a fault is, and why the system is failing.
  We present Semantic Fault Diagnosis (SFD), a technique that leverages lexicographic
  and dynamic information to automatically capture natural-language fault descriptors.
  SFD utilizes class names, method names, variable expressions, developer comments,
  and keywords from the source code to describe a fault. SFD can be used immediately
  after observing a failing execution and requires no input from developers or bug
  reports. In addition we present motivating examples and results from a SFD prototype
  to serve as a proof of concept.
