abstract: In this New Ideas and Emerging Results paper, we present a novel visualization,
  THE BRAIN, that reveals clusters of source code that co-execute to produce behavioral
  features of the program throughout and within executions. We created a clustered
  visualization of source-code that is informed by dynamic control flow of multiple
  executions; each cluster represents commonly interacting logic that composes software
  features. In addition, we render individual executions atop the clustered multiple-execution
  visualization as user-controlled animations to reveal characteristics of specific
  executions-these animations may provide exemplars for the clustered features and
  provide chronology for those behavioral features, or they may reveal anomalous behaviors
  that do not fit with the overall operational profile of most executions. Both the
  clustered multiple-execution view and the animated individual-execution view provide
  insights for the constituent behaviors within executions that compose behaviors
  of whole executions. Inspired by neural imaging of human brains of people who were
  subjected to various external stimuli, we designed and implemented THE BRAIN to
  reveal program activity during execution. The result has revealed the principal
  behaviors of execution, and those behaviors were revealed to be (in some cases)
  cohesive, modular source-code structures and (in other cases) cross-cutting, emergent
  behaviors that involve multiple modules. In this paper, we describe THE BRAIN and
  envisage the uses to which it can be put, and we provide two example usage scenarios
  to demonstrate its utility.
