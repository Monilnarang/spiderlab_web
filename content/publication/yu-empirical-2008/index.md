abstract: Fault-localization techniques that utilize information about all test cases
  in a test suite have been presented. These techniques use various approaches to
  identify the likely faulty part(s) of a program, based on information about the
  execution of the program with the test suite. Researchers have begun to investigate
  the impact that the composition of the test suite has on the effectiveness of these
  fault-localization techniques. In this paper, we present the first experiment on
  one aspect of test-suite compositionâ€“test-suite reduction. Our experiment studies
  the impact of the test-suite reduction on the effectiveness of fault-localization
  techniques. In our experiment, we apply 10 test-suite reduction strategies to test
  suites for eight subject programs. We then measure the differences between the effectiveness
  of four existing fault-localization techniques on the unreduced and reduced test
  suites. We also measure the reduction in test-suite size of the 10 test-suite reduction
  strategies. Our experiment shows that fault-localization effectiveness varies depending
  on the test-suite reduction strategy used, and it demonstrates the trade-offs between
  test-suite reduction and fault-localization effectiveness.
