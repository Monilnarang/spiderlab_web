abstract: In crowdsourced software testing, inspecting the large number of test reports
  is an overwhelming but inevitable software maintenance task. In recent years, to
  alleviate this task, many text-based test-report classification and prioritization
  techniques have been proposed. However in the mobile testing domain, test reports
  often consist of more screenshots and shorter descriptive text, and thus text-based
  techniques may be ineffective or inapplicable. The shortage and ambiguity of natural-language
  text information and the well defined screenshots of activity views within mobile
  applications motivate our novel technique based on using image understanding for
  multi-objective test-report prioritization. In this paper, by taking the similarity
  of screenshots into consideration, we present a multi-objective optimization-based
  prioritization technique to assist inspections of crowdsourced test reports. In
  our technique, we employ the Spatial Pyramid Matching (SPM) technique to measure
  the similarity of the screenshots, and apply the natural-language processing technique
  to measure the distance between the text of test reports. Furthermore, to validate
  our technique, an experiment with more than 600 test reports and 2500 images is
  conducted. The experimental results show that image-understanding techniques can
  provide benefit to test-report prioritization for most applications.
