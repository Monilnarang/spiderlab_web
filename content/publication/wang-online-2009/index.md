abstract: Web service technology aims to enable the interoperation of heterogeneous
  systems and the reuse of distributed functions in an unprecedented scale and has
  achieved significant success. There are still, however, challenges to realize its
  full potential. One of these challenges is to ensure the behavior of Web services
  consistent with their requirements. Monitoring events that are relevant to Web service
  requirements is, thus, an important technique. This paper introduces an online monitoring
  approach for Web service requirements. It includes a pattern-based specification
  of service constraints that correspond to service requirements, and a monitoring
  model that covers five kinds of system events relevant to client request, service
  response, application, resource, and management, and a monitoring framework in which
  different probes and agents collect events and data that are sensitive to requirements.
  The framework analyzes the collected information against the prespecified constraints,
  so as to evaluate the behavior and use of Web services. The prototype implementation
  and experiments with a case study shows that our approach is effective and flexible,
  and the monitoring cost is affordable.
