abstract: This paper presents a scalable, statement-level visualization that shows
  related code in a way that supports human interpretation of clustering and context.
  The visualization is applicable to many software-engineering tasks through the utilization
  and visualization of problem-specific meta-data. The visualization models statement-level
  code relations from a system-dependence-graph model of the program being visualized.
  Dynamic, run-time information is used to augment the static program model to further
  enable visual cluster identification and interpretation. In addition, we performed
  a user study of our visualization on an example program domain. The results of the
  study show that our new visualization successfully revealed relevant context to
  the programmer participants.
