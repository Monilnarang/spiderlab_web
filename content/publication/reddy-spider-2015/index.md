abstract: Today, many of the research innovations in software visualization and comprehension
  are evaluated on small-scale programs in a way that avoids actual human evaluation,
  despite the fact that these techniques are designed to help programmers develop
  and understand large and complex software. The investments required to perform such
  human studies often outweigh the need to publish. As such, the goal of this work
  (and toolkit) is to enable the evaluation of software visualizations of real-life
  software systems by its actual developers, as well as to understand the factors
  that influence adoption. The approach is to directly assist practicing software
  developers with visualizations through open and online collaboration tools. The
  mechanism by which we accomplish this goal is an online service that is linked through
  the projects' revision-control and build systems. We are calling this system SPIDER
  SENSE, and it includes web-based visualizations for software exploration that is
  supported by tools for mirroring development activities, automatic building and
  testing, and automatic instrumentation to gather dynamic-analysis data. In the future,
  we envision the system and toolkit to become a framework on which further visualizations
  and analyses are developed. SPIDER SENSE is open-source and publicly available for
  download and collaborative development.
