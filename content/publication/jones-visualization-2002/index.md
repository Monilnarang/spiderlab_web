abstract: One of the most expensive and time-consuming components of the debugging
  process is locating the errors or faults. To locate faults, developers must identify
  statements involved in failures and select suspicious statements that might contain
  faults. This paper presents a new technique that uses visualization to assist with
  these tasks. The technique uses color to visually map the participation of each
  program statement in the outcome of the execution of the program with a test suite,
  consisting of both passed and failed test cases. Based on this visual mapping, a
  user can inspect the statements in the program, identify statements involved in
  failures, and locate potentially faulty statements. The paper also describes a prototype
  tool that implements our technique along with a set of empirical studies that use
  the tool for evaluation of the technique. The empirical studies show that, for the
  subject we studied, the technique can be effective in helping a user locate faults
  in a program.
