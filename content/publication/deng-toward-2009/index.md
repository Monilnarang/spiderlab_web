abstract: As an effective approach to maintain software system without interrupting
  the service, online migration has been applied for many goals, e.g. achieving a
  higher system performance, tolerating faults, and upgrading systems. In this paper,
  we propose a middleware-based approach for online application migration. Independent
  from the operating system, middleware not only provides information required to
  perform migration, but also offers a flexible and efficient way for online application
  migration. We implement our approach on the J2EE platform, one of the most important
  middleware platforms in recent years. A J2EE ap plication migration framework (JAMF)
  is developed to demonstrate the proposed approach. The experiments with two typical
  examples show that our approach is feasible and effective.
