abstract: To perform a number of tasks such as inferring design rationale from past
  code changes or assessing developer expertise for a software feature or bug, the
  evolution of a set of lines of code can be assessed by mining software histories.
  However, determining the evolution of a set of lines of code is a manual and time
  consuming process. This paper presents a model of this process and an approach for
  automating it. We call this process History Slicing. We describe the process and
  options for generating a graph that links every line of code with its corresponding
  previous revision through the history of the software project. We then explain the
  method and options for utilizing this graph to determine the exact revisions that
  contain changes for the lines of interest and their exact position in each revision.
  Finally, we present some preliminary results which show initial evidence that our
  automated technique can be several orders of magnitude faster than the manual approach
  and require that developers examine up to two orders of magnitude less code in extracting
  such histories.
