abstract: In this paper, we present CHRONOS-a tool that enables the querying, exploration,
  and discovery of historical change events to source code. Unlike traditional Revision-Control-System
  tools, CHRONOS allows queries across any subset of the code, down to the line-level,
  which can potentially be contiguous or disparate, even among multiple files. In
  addition, CHRONOS provides change history across all historical versions (i.e.,
  it is not limited to a pairwise “diff”). The tool implements a zoom-able user interface
  as a visualization of the history of the queried code to provide both a high-level
  view of the changes, which supports pattern recognition and discovery, and a low-level
  view that supports semantic comprehension for tasks such as reverse engineering
  and identifying design rationale. In this paper, we describe use cases in which
  CHRONOS may be helpful, provide a motivating example to demonstrate the benefits
  brought by CHRONOS, and describe its visualization in detail.
