abstract: While the use of independent test agencies is on the rise - currently estimated
  to be a $25B marketplace - there are a number of challenges to successful collaboration
  between these agencies and their client software development organizations. These
  agencies offer independent verification of software, skilled testing experts, and
  economic advantages that arise from differential global labor rates. However, these
  benefits are often offset by difficulties in effectively integrating the outsourced
  testing into software development practice. We conducted extensive discussions with
  test managers and engineers at software development organizations. This position
  paper presents the findings of these discussions that identify key difficulties
  of integrating independent test agencies into software development practice, and
  it describes our position on how these findings can be addressed.
