abstract: The high cost of locating faults in programs has motivated the development
  of techniques that assist in fault localization by automating part of the process
  of searching for faults. Empirical studies that compare these techniques have reported
  the relative effectiveness of four existing techniques on a set of subjects. These
  studies compare the rankings that the techniques compute for statements in the subject
  programs and the effectiveness of these rankings in locating the faults. However,
  it is unknown how these four techniques compare with Tarantula, another existing
  fault-localization technique, although this technique also provides a way to rank
  statements in terms of their suspiciousness. Thus, we performed a study to compare
  the Tarantula technique with the four techniques previously compared. This paper
  presents our study---it overviews the Tarantula technique along with the four other
  techniques studied, describes our experiment, and reports and discusses the results.
  Our studies show that, on the same set of subjects, the Tarantula technique consistently
  outperforms the other four techniques in terms of effectiveness in fault localization,
  and is comparable in efficiency to the least expensive of the other four techniques.
