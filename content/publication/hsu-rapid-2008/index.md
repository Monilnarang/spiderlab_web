abstract: Most existing fault-localization techniques focus on identifying and reporting
  single statements that may contain a fault. Even in cases where a fault involves
  a single statement, it is generally hard to understand the fault by looking at that
  statement in isolation. Faults typically manifest themselves in a specific context,
  and knowing that context is necessary to diagnose and correct the fault. In this
  paper, we present a novel fault-localization technique that identifies sequences
  of statements that lead to a failure. The technique works by analyzing partial execution
  traces corresponding to failing executions and identifying common segments in these
  traces, incrementally. Our approach provides developers a context that is likely
  to result in a more directed approach to fault understanding and a lower overall
  cost for debugging.
