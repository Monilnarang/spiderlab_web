abstract: 'The presence of multiple faults in a program can inhibit the ability of
  fault-localization techniques to locate the faults. This problem occurs for two
  reasons: when a program fails, the number of faults is, in general, unknown; and
  certain faults may mask or obfuscate other faults. This paper presents our approach
  to solving this problem that leverages the well-known advantages of parallel work
  flows to reduce the time-to-release of a program. Our approach consists of a technique
  that enables more effective debugging in the presence of multiple faults and a methodology
  that enables multiple developers to simultaneously debug multiple faults. The paper
  also presents an empirical study that demonstrates that our parallel-debugging technique
  and methodology can yield a dramatic decrease in total debugging time compared to
  a one-fault-at-a-time, or conventionally sequential, approach.'
