abstract: One of the main challenges in distributed development is ensuring effective
  communication and coordination among the distributed teams. In this context, little
  attention has been paid so far to coordination in software testing. In distributed
  development environments, testing is often performed by specialized teams that operate
  as independent quality assurance centers. The use of these centers can be advantageous
  from both an economic and a software quality perspective. These benefits, however,
  are offset by severe difficulties in coordination between testing and software development
  centers. Test centers operate as isolated silos and have little to no interactions
  with developers, which can result in multiple problems that lead to poor quality
  of software. Based on our preliminary investigation, we claim that we need to rethink
  the way testing is performed in distributed development environments. We then present
  a possible research agenda that would help address the identified issues and discuss
  the main challenges involved.
