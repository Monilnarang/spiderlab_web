abstract: Studying vast volumes of bug and issue discussions can give an understanding
  of what the community has been most concerned about, however the magnitude of documents
  can overload the analyst. We present an approach to analyze the development of the
  Android open source project by observing trends in the bug discussions in the Android
  open source project public issue tracker. This informs us of the features or parts
  of the project that are more problematic at any given point of time. In turn, this
  can be used to aid resource allocation (such as time and man power) to parts or
  features. We support these ideas by presenting the results of issue topic distributions
  over time using statistical analysis of the bug descriptions and comments for the
  Android open source project. Furthermore, we show relationships between those time
  distributions and major development releases of the Android OS.
